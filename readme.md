# Action Maps

We are inspired by the tall vantage point afforded us by our window in one of the tallest buildings on the west coast--planes flying past, helicopters, police and firefighter sirens--truly the heartbeat of the city of LA is on display. We have realized that this is a way to deeply comprehend what is going on in the city in real time, like no other. There's such a wealth of information available about the world we live in, but we've been forced until now to compress this data to a two-dimensional plane. 

This project, Action Maps, attempts to demonstrate the power of VR by merging multiple real-time data sources and giving the user a never-before experienced flow of information about Los Angeles.
